**Hey there,**

Thanks for coming to Nostrasia2025,

and for stopping by this site.

This page is just me casually listing my role and contributions at Nostrasia2025, so if you're not interested, feel free to swipe all the way to the end.

# Why am I here?

So, as before, I've been placed on the organizing side, continuing that flow.

However, my role is different this time.

Last year I was at the reception desk, but this year I'm handling merchandise sales.

On top of that, I've also redesigned the monitor projection. Please see the article below:

[Here](/works/nostrasia-eng)

Also, this year we're selling stickers at the merchandise booth.

You'll find out more details when you visit the merchandise booth.

Lastly, I'd really appreciate it if you could reply to this with a quick message.

It doesn't mean anything special, but it serves as proof you visited the site.
